## 🟣 Optional: Brand Wallet / Credit System

### 1️⃣ Core Idea

Instead of paying per deal every time, brands can:
- 💰 Add money to platform wallet in advance
- 💳 Maintain wallet balance
- ⚡ Use wallet balance to fund deals instantly

**Flow:**
```
Add Money → Wallet Balance → Create Deal → Auto-Deduct from Wallet
```

---

### 2️⃣ Why This is Useful

**Benefits for Brands:**
- ⚡ Faster deal creation (no repeated payments)
- 🏃 No payment gateway redirect every time
- 💼 Bulk campaign convenience
- 🎯 Smooth auction funding
- 💎 Professional business experience

**Benefits for Platform:**
- 💰 Money already secured
- 🔒 Higher trust and retention
- 🎯 Increased brand lock-in
- 📈 Brands become invested in ecosystem

---

### 3️⃣ How It Works

**Step 1: Add Credits**
- Brand dashboard → Wallet section
- Quick options:
  - Add ₹5,000
  - Add ₹10,000
  - Add ₹25,000
  - Custom amount
- Payment via PayU gateway
- Money goes to platform merchant account
- Wallet balance updated instantly

**Step 2: Create Deal**
When brand:
- Accepts influencer quote
- Accepts auction bid
- Converts chat to deal

System automatically:
- Checks if wallet balance ≥ deal amount
- If yes → Deducts deal amount from wallet
- Marks deal as **"Funded"**
- No external payment needed at that moment

**Step 3: Influencer Works**
Normal flow continues:
```
Promotion → Review → Approval → Payout
```

---

### 4️⃣ Wallet Logic Rules

**Wallet CAN Be Used For:**
- ✅ Direct deal funding
- ✅ Auction campaign funding
- ✅ Extra campaign slot purchases

**Wallet CANNOT Be Used For:**
- ❌ Registration fees
- ❌ Product verification fees (optional - can allow)
- ❌ Subscription payments

---

### 5️⃣ Wallet Transaction Types

**Each wallet maintains complete history:**
- 💰 Deposit (added funds)
- ➖ Deal deduction (used for deal)
- ↩️ Refund credit (cancelled deal)
- ⚙️ Admin adjustment (if needed)

**Full transparency required.**

---

### 6️⃣ Refund Scenario

**If deal cancelled before work starts:**
- Amount **refunded to wallet** (not bank)
- Brand can:
  - ✅ Reuse for another campaign immediately
  - OR
  - ✅ Request withdrawal to bank (optional feature)

---

### 7️⃣ Withdrawal Option (Optional)

**Brand may request wallet withdrawal:**

**Rules:**
- Minimum withdrawal: ₹1,000
- Processing time: 2-3 working days
- Small processing fee: ₹10 or 1% (optional)

**You can decide this later based on needs.**

---

### 8️⃣ Security Benefits

**Wallet ensures:**
- ✅ Brand seriousness (skin in the game)
- ✅ Faster auction bid acceptance
- ✅ Reduced failed deal scenarios
- ✅ Less payment delays
- ✅ Lower payment gateway load
- ✅ Better user experience

---

### 9️⃣ Wallet Caps (Optional Control)

**You may define limits:**

**Individual Brand:**
- Max wallet balance: ₹50,000

**Business Brand:**
- Unlimited wallet balance

**Purpose:** Risk management and fraud prevention

---

### 🔟 AI Risk Control

**System must monitor:**
- 🚨 High deposit with no campaign activity
- 🚨 Suspicious withdrawal patterns
- 🚨 Chargeback risk indicators

**Admin panel should:**
- 👁️ View wallet balance per brand
- ⏸️ Freeze wallet if fraud suspected
- 📊 Audit complete transaction logs
- 📈 Monitor deposit vs spend ratio

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ Comparison: Original vs Wallet Model

**🔹 Original Model (Pay Per Deal)**
- ✅ Simple
- ✅ Low complexity
- ❌ Payment friction each time
- ❌ Higher transaction fees

**🔹 Wallet Model (Pre-Fund)**
- ✅ Faster campaigns
- ✅ More professional feel
- ✅ Better for high-volume brands
- ✅ Higher retention
- ❌ More accounting complexity
- ❌ Requires withdrawal compliance

---

### 1️⃣2️⃣ Final Structure

**With wallet modification, brands have TWO funding options:**

**Option A: Pay Per Deal** (Original model)
- Direct PayU payment for each deal
- Simple, straightforward
- Good for occasional users

**Option B: Wallet System** (Modification)
- Add funds in advance
- Instant deal funding
- Better for frequent users

**Both options can coexist.**

---

### Important Decision Point

**If you implement wallet system:**

You must manage:
- ✅ Proper accounting and reconciliation
- ✅ Careful refund logic
- ✅ Withdrawal compliance (tax implications)
- ✅ Payment gateway settlement matching
- ✅ Fraud detection for deposits

**It increases system complexity but adds professionalism and scale readiness.**

---

### Wallet Modification Summary

✅ Deals auto-deduct from wallet  
✅ Refunds return to wallet  
✅ Optional withdrawal feature  
✅ Faster auction campaign funding

### Cost Calculation Examples

#### Example 1: Small Deal (Basic Influencer)

```
Deal Value: ₹10,000
Commission Rate: 1% (Basic)
Commission Amount: ₹100

Brand Pays: ₹10,100
PayU Fee (UPI 0.9%): ₹90.90
Platform Net: ₹10,009.10
Influencer Payout: ₹10,000
Platform Revenue: ₹9.10
```

---

#### Example 2: Medium Deal (Pro Influencer)

```
Deal Value: ₹25,000
Commission Rate: 0.5% (Pro)
Commission Amount: ₹125

Brand Pays: ₹25,125
PayU Fee (UPI 0.9%): ₹226.13
Platform Net: ₹24,898.87
Influencer Payout: ₹25,000
Platform Revenue: -₹101.13 (LOSS on this deal)
```

**Note:** This shows why high volume is critical for profitability.

---

#### Example 3: Large Deal (Pro Influencer)

```
Deal Value: ₹100,000
Commission Rate: 0.5% (Pro)
Commission Amount: ₹500

Brand Pays: ₹100,500
PayU Fee (UPI 0.9%): ₹904.50
Platform Net: ₹99,595.50
Influencer Payout: ₹100,000
Platform Revenue: -₹404.50 (LOSS on this deal)
```

**Critical Insight:** For 0.5% commission model to be profitable, need to encourage:
1. Credit card payments (lower than 1.9% fee)
2. Wallet payments with brand absorbing fees
3. Very high deal volumes
4. Focus on Basic users (1% commission) initially

---

### Fee Optimization Strategy

**Encourage UPI Payments:**
- Lowest fee (0.9%)
- Offer 0.5% discount on commission for UPI
- Highlight UPI at checkout

**Discourage Credit Cards:**
- Highest fee (1.9%)
- Consider passing fee to user
- Show "UPI Recommended" badge

**Wallet Preloading:**
- Encourage brands to use wallet system
- One deposit, multiple deals
- Reduces per-transaction fees

### 3. AI Fraud Monitoring System

**Purpose:** Detect and prevent bypass deals where users circumvent platform commissions

---

#### A. Chat Monitoring (Real-Time)

**Suspicious Keywords Detected:**

**Direct Payment Mentions:**
- "pay me directly"
- "transfer to my account"
- "avoid commission"
- "outside the platform"
- "send money to"

**External Communication:**
- "WhatsApp me"
- "call me at"
- "email me at"
- "DM on Instagram"
- "add me on Telegram"

**Bypass Indicators:**
- "offline deal"
- "private arrangement"
- "let's talk elsewhere"

---

**Detection Logic:**

**1. NLP Model:**
- Scans every chat message in real-time
- BERT-based transformer model
- Fine-tuned on platform chat data

**2. Pattern Matching:**
- Phone numbers (10-digit patterns)
- Email addresses (regex)
- Social media handles (@username)
- URL patterns

**3. Context Analysis:**
- "Let's discuss payment on WhatsApp" = HIGH RISK
- "My Instagram is @username" (in context) = MEDIUM RISK
- Normal conversation = LOW RISK

**4. Risk Scoring:**
- Scale: 0-100
- Calculated per message
- Cumulative score per user

---

**Action Triggers:**

| Risk Score | Action | Notification |
|---|---|---|
| **60-79** | Warning popup to both users | "Platform policies reminder" |
| **80-100** | Chat flagged for admin review | Admin notification sent |
| **Repeated (3+ times)** | 24-hour chat suspension | Email warning |

---

#### B. Content Monitoring (Post-Deal Analysis)

**Scenario Detection:**
1. Chat occurred between brand and influencer
2. Deal NOT officially closed on platform
3. Influencer posts branded content within 30 days

**Monitoring Process:**
1. Daily scan of influencer channels (via APIs)
2. Check for brand mentions:
   - Product name in caption
   - Brand handle tags
   - Sponsored hashtags (#ad, #sponsored)
3. Compare with closed deal records
4. If mismatch found → Flag for investigation

**Verification Steps:**
1. Admin reviews chat history
2. Checks posted content for brand collaboration
3. Contacts both parties for explanation
4. If bypass confirmed → Apply penalty

---

#### C. Punishment System

| Offense | Penalty | Unban Process |
|---|---|---|
| **First bypass** | 30-day suspension + ₹5,000 fine | Pay fine + warning acceptance |
| **Second bypass** | 90-day suspension + ₹15,000 fine | Pay fine + probation period |
| **Third bypass** | Permanent ban (no unban) | Account deleted |
